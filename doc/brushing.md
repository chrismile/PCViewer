# Brushing Documentation
A big feature of the PCViewer application is the interactive brushing, even of large datasets, including the simultaneous update of linked view such as the [Bubble Plotter](scatterplot.md), the [Iso surface renderer](iso.md) or the [Violin plots](violin.md).

Brushing itself is the act of choosing a subset of a dataset. In our application the brushing is only done directly on the axes, as this has proven to be the most intuitive brushing with still very good usability.

In the PCViewer 2 kinds of brushing are available. Global and Local brushes.

### Local brushes

### Global brushes
